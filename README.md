## ✨ Features

GeminiDesk is more than just a web wrapper. It's a carefully crafted desktop experience loaded with features to supercharge your workflow.

* **📌 Always-On-Top Mode**: Keep Gemini visible over all other windows. Perfect for referencing, coding, or multitasking without losing context.

* **📸 Screenshot to Chat**: Instantly capture any part of your screen. The image is copied to your clipboard and automatically pasted into the chat, ready to be analyzed by Gemini.

* **⚡ On-the-Fly Model Switching**: Use global hotkeys to start a new chat with the exact Gemini model you need, instantly. No more manual switching.

* **⚙️ Full Customization**: Open the settings panel (`⚙️`) to tailor GeminiDesk to your needs.
    * Toggle "Run on Startup" and "Always on Top".
    * Customize every global keyboard shortcut to match your workflow.
    * Manually check for updates or reset the app to its default settings.

* **🧠 Dynamic Header**: The custom draggable header bar displays the title of your current conversation, helping you keep track of different chats.

* **🚀 Smart Updates**: The app checks for new versions once a day in the background. If an update is found, it notifies you with a simple dialog—no automatic downloads. You get a direct link to the latest GitHub release.

* **🎤 Persistent Microphone Permissions**: Grant microphone access once, and the app remembers your choice for seamless voice-to-text input.

* **🔒 Persistent Login**: Sign in to your Google account once, and GeminiDesk keeps you logged in across sessions.

* **💼 Lightweight & Focused**: Enjoy a dedicated environment for Gemini without the memory and CPU overhead of a full web browser.
